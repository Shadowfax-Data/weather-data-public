This repository contains tools and data for processing weather information from NOAA's Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN).

## Data Sources

- Weather data is sourced from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI):
  - ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily
  - ftp.ncei.noaa.gov
- ZIP code geographic data is sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau (census.gov)

## Methodology

The system combines three primary data sources to produce zipcode-level daily weather metrics:

1. **NOAA Station Readings** (`ghcn_daily_raw`): Raw weather observations from NOAA's Global Historical Climatology Network, including precipitation, temperature, snow measurements and other metrics.

2. **NOAA Station Location Data** (`ghcnd_stations`): Geographic coordinates and metadata for each NOAA weather station.

3. **ZIP Code Gazette** (`zipcodes`): Geographic information about ZIP codes, including centroid coordinates.

### Data Processing Pipeline

The processing occurs in two main stages:

#### Stage 1: Linking ZIP Codes to Weather Stations

The `compute_zipcode_stations.py` script creates a relationship table (`zipcode_stations`) that maps each ZIP code to its nearest weather stations:

1. For each ZIP code, the script calculates the distance to all weather stations using the Haversine formula (which accounts for Earth's curvature).
2. Performance optimizations include:
   - Pre-filtering stations based on latitude/longitude differences (â‰¤ 5 degrees)
   - Setting a maximum distance threshold (200 miles)
   - Processing ZIP codes in batches to manage memory usage
3. The script ranks stations by proximity to each ZIP code and stores the N closest stations.
4. The resulting table includes distance information and geographic coordinates of both the ZIP code and the station.

#### Stage 2: Computing Daily Weather Metrics by ZIP Code

The `compute_daily_metric.py` script generates daily weather metrics for each ZIP code (`zipcode_daily_metrics`):

1. The script filters the `zipcode_stations` table to include only stations within a specified distance (default: 20 miles).
2. For each date in the specified range:
   - Weather observations from `ghcn_daily_raw` are joined with filtered stations.
   - Quality-flagged data is excluded.
   - For each weather element (PRCP, SNOW, SNWD, TMAX, TMIN), the script calculates:
     - Average value across all stations for each ZIP code
     - Count of observations
     - Standard deviation of observations
3. The aggregated metrics are pivoted into a wide format with columns for each weather element.
4. Results are stored in the `zipcode_daily_metrics` table with year, month, and day components extracted for easier querying.

This methodology enables the creation of a comprehensive dataset that provides daily weather metrics for any ZIP code with nearby weather stations, effectively interpolating point-based weather observations to area-based geographic regions.
